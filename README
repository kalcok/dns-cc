For build instructions see INSTALL.

After succesfull build you have executable file "dns-cc" that is ready to 
be used. You can place this file anywhere you like, it is not dependent
on any other files except config file.
Config file, "dns.cfg" is located in src directory, in project root. It
already contains sample configuration. By default, dns-cc looks for this
config file in /etc/dns-cc/ directory. If you do not wish to place it there,
you will have to specify location of config file manually each time you run 
dns-cc.

For more information on how to run dns-cc see help via "dns-cc -v".

Test Enviroment:
For testing purposes, this distribution contains Vagrantfile that serves as
configuration file for vagrant tool. You can run "vagrant up" in project root
to spawn testing environment.
This environment consists of three virtual machines that each server as DNS
server. Sample config file provided in src folder works out of the box with
this testing envirnment.
